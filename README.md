GraphiteKit
===========

GraphiteKit is an Objective-C wrapper for OS X around the Graphite (http://graphite.sil.org) text shaping library.

In order to build this library, you need the latest source tarball for graphite.
# Download the src tarball from http://projects.palaso.org/projects/graphitedev/files
# Extract into the directory next to GraphiteKit.  It will most likely have a version number in the directory.
# In Terminal, go to the GraphiteKit directory and create a soft link from the extracted graphite directory to a directory named 'graphite' (e.x. ln -s ../graphite2-1.2.3 graphite2)
